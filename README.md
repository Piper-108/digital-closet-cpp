# Digital Closet: A C++ Cataloging System 👗
This project is a command-line application designed to manage a personal wardrobe, inspired by the digital closet in the movie *Clueless*.

## 🎓 Academic Context
As a **Library and Information Science student** trying to transit into **Computer Science**, I built this project to explore the intersection of information organization and software development. It applies cataloging principles to digital asset management.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Data Persistence:** Uses File I/O to save and load wardrobe data from `.txt` files.
- **CRUD Operations:** Supports adding, viewing, and deleting outfit items.
- **Randomization:** Includes a "random outfit generator" logic.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Compile using any C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ cluelesscloset.cpp -o closet`).
2. Run the executable and follow the on-screen menu instructions.
